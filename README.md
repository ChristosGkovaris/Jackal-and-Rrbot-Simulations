# Robotics Project

Welcome to the "Robotics Project", a simulation of a mobile robot named Jackal and a robotic manipulator called Rrbot, both implemented in Python. The goal is to run a simulation for both robots and navigate them through a virtual environment. This project was implemented during the sixth semester, in the course MYE031 of the curriculum of the University of Ioannina. The final grade of the project is 7 out of 10.


## Jackal Mobile Robot
- **Objective:** Calculate the required trajectories of Jackal, using the given data.
- **How to control:** Use the command-line to control Jackal.
- **Feedback:** Observe the final position of Jackal.


## Rrbot Arm
- **Objective:** Calculate the required trajectories of Rrbot, using the given data.
- **How to control:** Use the command-line to control Rrbot.
- **Feedback:** Observe the final angle of Rrbot.


## Implementation Details
- To give commands to the robot, use the command-line.
- Using the Gazebo environment, you can add obstacles.


## How to Run
- **Clone the Repository:**
  ``` bash
      git clone https://github.com/ChristosGkovaris/Robotics-Project.git
      cd Robotics-Project
- **Ensure you have Python installed:** The project requires Python 3.
- **Ensure you have ROS installed:** The simulation requires ROS 1.
